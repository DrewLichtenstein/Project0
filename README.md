# Project 0

Created simple HTML pages about three places I am going to this year (Iceland, Hawaii, Spain). Index is a table of images to click to other pages, each of which contains a basic list (stylized using SCSS) and a collection of facts laid out with a Bootstrap
Grid. Horizontal navigation bar on top links the pages together.

Thank you!
